Hello Mat,
We have found 10+ alerts in NetSkope in which the user -xyz@murdock.ai- has uploaded the source codes (python files) to a GitHub repository (abcd-xyz.s3.amazonaws.com/).
 We did not find any exceptions for this user to upload in [Application Name e.g:GitHub]. The upload was done using his personal email id - xyx@gmail.com.
This is suspicious behavior and so we have contained the user- xyz@murdock.ai  from Okta, Jamf, Crowdstrike and in Intune.
